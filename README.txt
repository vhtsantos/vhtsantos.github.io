Portfolio Website
=================

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio. It is a customised version of the Spectral theme from HTML5 UP, adapted to present my work in AR, VR, Unity, robotics, 3D modelling, and audiovisual production.

The objective of this site is to provide a clear and functional overview of my projects, without unnecessary complexity.

About the Template
------------------

The website uses the Spectral base template, which offers:

• A fully responsive structure built with flexbox  
• A modular layout based on HTML5 UP’s Responsive Tools  
• Sass organisation that I adapted and simplified  
• Pre-styled elements that I repurposed for my own sections

All design changes, components, layout modifications, and content are customised by me.
